# Airline-Sentian--Sentiment-Analysis-using-Text-Classification
Twitter is widely accessible social network and heavily used to express individual thoughts on specific topics online. It can be regarded as a valuable source to gather information on user opinions concerning certain issues. Especially, for purposes of business, it has become of great importance to constantly monitor online sentiments based on textual data.

The data set contains US airline tweets labelled according to their sentiment. The data has been processed in order to train a deep neural network (DNN) that serves as a text sentiment classifier model. The aim is to evaluate the performance of a custom trained word vectorization approach in the context of pre-processing and dimension reduction for tweet text analysis. In addition, the final model is applied to recently extracted tweet data related to a selected US airline to demonstrate the model performance in real-world use cases.

The architecture of the model consists of an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a Dense layer at the end.

Keras based Model Pipeline -LSTM Network
LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory Networks.LSTM networks work well with time-series data

The sentiment analysis model gives the predicted output as positive or negative based on the sentiment in the input text.
