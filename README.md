# Airline-Sentian--Sentiment-Analysis-using-Text-Classification

This project focuses on the automated detection of sentiment from various textual comments and feedback related to airlines. Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, the project classifies sentiments into categories such as positive, negative, and neutral. It leverages Keras, TensorFlow, and LSTM networks for building the classification model.

# Overview 
Twitter is widely accessible social network and heavily used to express individual thoughts on specific topics online. It can be regarded as a valuable source to gather information on user opinions concerning certain issues. 

The data set contains US airline tweets labelled according to their sentiment. The data has been processed in order to train a deep neural network (DNN) that serves as a text sentiment classifier model. The aim is to evaluate the performance of a custom trained word vectorization approach in the context of pre-processing and dimension reduction for tweet text analysis. In addition, the final model is applied to recently extracted tweet data related to a selected US airline to demonstrate the model performance in real-world use cases.

With the growth of online reviews and customer feedback, it has become crucial for businesses, especially in the airline industry, to analyze sentiment effectively. This project aims to classify customer feedback into different sentiment categories using text classification techniques.

The model is built using Keras and TensorFlow, with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for sentiment analysis. LSTMs are known for their efficiency in processing sequential data like text, making them ideal for this task.



The architecture of the model consists of an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a Dense layer at the end.

LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory Networks.LSTM networks work well with time-series data

The sentiment analysis model gives the predicted output as positive or negative based on the sentiment in the input text.
